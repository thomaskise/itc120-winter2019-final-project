    <h3>AAPI Perspectives on The AMP</h3>
    <strong>
    <p>
        March 9<br />
        Learn about The AMP: AIDS Memorial Pathway from Lead Artist Horatio Law! This event is co-presented by the Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS).<br />

        The AMP will be completed in 2020 above the Capitol Hill Light Rail Station and the north edge of Cal Anderson Park. Weâ€™ll share details of this multi-media public art project, and show some videos that are part of our story collection initiative.<br />

        Also, Victor Loo from ACRS will provide information addressing access and health disparities for LGBTQ people in AAPI and other POC communities.
