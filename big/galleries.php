    <p>Image galleries are the way to share portfolios online. They run the gamut of designs and possibilities. Some are simple and some more complex.  They can be created simply with CSS and HTML. Feature rich galleries generally employ JavaScript and JQuery. There are a zillion formats for galleries and a zillion ways to implement each one.<br /><br />
    

    The first thing to keep in mind, I’ll call it rule #1, is that the gallery is a showcase for your images, so focus on the best presentation to suit your purpose, not the coolest gallery. Too much glitz can deter from the images that are the main feature. So be mindful. Consider the purpose of your gallery and focus your gallery shopping on the best way to present the subject matter and quality you are addressing in your current assignment.<br /><br />

    What is the purpose? Each has different needs for quality, quick access, and even given rule #1, there snazziness may play into the presentation. </p>

    <p>I currently have a client who has a kids after school ceramics program. We are working on his website redesign. One important requirement comes from the kids - they want to see their work. When they are “presenting” to their family and friends, they want to get to it fast and they want it to look good.<br /><br />

        To this end, I’m recommending a jQuery slider. “jQuery sliders offer a simple, elegant way to display content without giving up valuable real estate on your web page.(<a href="#curtziegler">Curt Zielgler</a>)”.  In the referenced article, Curt goes on to say that there are many different ways to implement these. The solution I have in mind hash images that flow along the bottom of the page and when clicked or tapped, a single image expands to the main page area. The user can either slide the main image to the previous or next, or they can go back to the thumbnail slider and quickly search through the gallery.<br /><br />

    I’ve provided some considerations in researching your need for an image gallery and an example of one solution. Don’t be intimidated, and don’t be overly concerned if your chosen format requires jQuery or Javascript. There are options out there you can download for free and very inexpensively. Many have Git repos you can access through github.com. <br /><br />

    While not referenced, my searches and specific articles are provided after my citations in the pdf version available to the right. Take a looks through (and do some searches of your own). You can find what you need, and you can implement it!
