        The first thing I considered when looking at shopping carts, should I buy one off the shelve, or build it myself.  I did little reading and soon concluded that I agreed with Irene Blush of Quora who stated, “[i]n short, stay away from a custom built ecommerce store, since you may screw something up … ” (Irene Blush).<br /><br />

        So what are the options buy package? What are the costs, more in terms of risk and time investment  than off the shelf pricing? What features are offered? Who has the most proven track record?<br /><br />

        I started doing some searching, and very quickly found a typical “not much help” result.  PC did offer a nice list of features on a few top names (Juan Martinez) , but mostly I found the typical barrage of marketing information without much in the way of feature lists and illustrations that really tell what the product can do for you can do for you.<br /><br />

        My net conclusion is to go for it. Find a cart that lets you use your own domain name, and install in on a subdomain (you own mydomain.com, install the shopping cart in ecommerce.mydomain.com) and try it.  If you already have a hosting company, they probably have some you can use for free. Get some experience, and if you don’t like what you’ve got, then at minimum you’ve built up some experience and have the vocabulary and background need to ask the “stupid” questions you didn’t even think of the first time around.<br /><br />

        For me?  I host at GoDaddy and DreamHost. I’m not too enthralled with GoDaddy, and their shopping cart was not rated too highly in the PC Mag (Juan Martinez) results, so I did a bit of validation on Zen Cart, free at DreamHost. Not highly rated either, but it got a 3+.   Apparently no Android or iPhone App solutions. There does seem to be some ability to customize. I’ll give it a whirl and  focus on a mobile first responsive site and see where that leaves me. <br /><br />
