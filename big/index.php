                <li><a href="http://fearlessideas.org/" target="_blank">Fearless Ideas</a> We discussed incorporating a dedicated space to inform parents &amp; students of registration dates, class changes and other information.This site uses an “announcement area” in the upper left. Yours is a smaller space, but I think we can use the concept as a model for what you want  One thing I like about this site is their use of rotating announcements. So in addition to having a place where you can post important updates, it can be used to feature new classes and other events hosted by Clay’s Cool.</li><br />
                <li><a href="https://www.creativehandsstudio.net//" target="_blank">Creative Hands Art School:</a> You mentioned wanting to be able to place a textual overlay over the home page image. This site uses a concept that rotates the text with a variety of messages. Take a look and let me know what you think. Also, we could add rotating images like they ave, and their home page fills the entire page. Any of this sound interesting</li><br />
                <li><a href="https://www.artscorps.org/programs/" target="_blank">Arts Corp:</a> Take a look at the banner across the top of the page. I think the page scales nicely to a mobile format also (see image below). We could do a similar approach with an image of some of your kids in class, or images of their works</li>
